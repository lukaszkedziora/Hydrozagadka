“I am absolutely intelligent!” (Dr. Smudge, the movie’s villain)

The first full console rougelike version of Hydrozagadka2 is a simple game based on a Polish cinematographic masterpiece from 1970 titled “Hydrozagadka”. The player can impersonate an avant-garde superhero called Ace, and fight with a crime genius – Dr. Smudge. This project is one of my first attempts in Python programming. During the game you can talk to characters, collect items, fight against bots, and finally - save the water in Warsaw.

## The game plot 
[from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozagadka)

Hydrozagadka (Polish: Hydro-puzzle) is a Polish superhero comedy film. During a summer heat wave, all the water in Warsaw is puzzlingly disappearing. Scientists secretly call upon As (Ace), a superhero who passes his days living as a mild-mannered engineer, to try to solve the mystery. It turns out that a mysterious Maharaja is in league with Doctor Spot (footnote: I actually like the “Dr. Smudge” translation better) to steal Poland's water and take it to the Maharaja's country.

The movie was ostensibly created as a Communist parody of the American ideals glorified in Superman and other superhero films, however Polish audiences instead felt that the film humorously parodied aspects of Polish life under Communist rule, such as the many slogans for a "better life."
